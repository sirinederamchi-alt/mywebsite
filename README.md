# MyWebsite

Skina is a teen-focused skincare site with a landing page, debunking myths section, quiz page, and simple login/register flow AS WELL As a database, https, and recommendations generator. 
This project is for my coursework and showcases the UI plus basic front-end interactions.

If I need to run it locally, I use a simple static server or GitHub Pages BY creating a repository and importing your folders and files and branching them to do this many tutorials are available like everywhere.
